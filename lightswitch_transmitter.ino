/* Project Wireless Lightswitch
 *  Purpose: wirelessly turn off LED's on top of 2 game stations
 *  How it works: USB connected to lightswitch outlet will output 5V or 0V.
 *  Upon receiving 5V, transmit RF signal to turn on 2 outlets (that have
 *  LED's connected). Upon 5V -> 0V, transmit RF signal to turn them off.
